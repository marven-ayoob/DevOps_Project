                                    The cloud storage system enables data and files to be stored by a cloud computer provider. It is accessible through the public internet or through a private connection link, so the owner of the data can access it from anywhere with internet access. While similar to server storage, the main difference is that cloud storage is within the jurisdiction of the provider, who is responsible for securely storing, managing and maintaining the network, servers and infrastructure. Storing data on the cloud removes the need for an individual organization to buy and manage storage themselves.

                            In comparison, on-premise or server storage requires an organization to have a local server hosted within the organization’s infrastructure which contains the company’s data . In many cases, these servers are typically hosted on-site, hence the name “local storage”. The organization’s in-house IT team and specialists are responsible for the upkeep, management and maintenance of this system. This approach also means that data and other information stored on local computers may only be shared through the local network, which in turn facilitates oversight of said data.
